  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>I love gummy bears. I would eat gummy bears for breakfast, lunch and dinner if no one would judge me. But you're probably looking for something a bit more descriptive than that.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for learning and am constantly trying new things. Whether it is a new recipe, a new crochet or knitting pattern (I learned to knit this year through youtube and online tutorials!), a new computer program or figuring out why a line of code does what it does, I enjoy thinking things out.</p>
    <p>I'm both logical and creative, but my logical side wins out more often than my creativity, especially when I am learning. This isn't always a bad thing. </p> 
    <p>Reading is another obsession of mine. Recently, I've been reading a ton of post-apocalyptic themed books, but will read almost anything that peaks my interest.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I'm originally from a small city outside of Philadelphia, PA, called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Harleysville,+PA+19438/@39.6601467,-74.385767,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c699335cf365e5:0xa1281c15ceccc3e0"  target="_blank">Harleysville</a>. I grew up in a large family. I am the second oldest of seven children. (five brothers and one sister - my sister is the baby of the family). Growing up it always shocked people to hear about the size of my family. To me it was normal but complete chaos. There was never a quiet moment!</p>
     <p>After college, I moved to Connecticut. I now live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norwalk,+CT/@41.4172352,-72.6859865,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e81c4a9c36c5b9:0x5dfa2209bc49d58d"  target="_blank">Norwalk, CT</a>. I have a daughter who is the center of my world and I would do anything for her.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What sort of professional background do you have?</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelors of Science in Art Education. During my time at college, I focused on studio arts including graphic design. After graduating, I taught for a few years and even though I enjoyed the being with children I realized teaching was not for me. I started getting back into graphic design and began relearning the Adobe Creative Suite. </p>
      <p>In 2010 I was hired by Penny-Dell Publications and learned Quark Xpress 6. I am a desktop publisher who designs both print and digital publications. Outside of work, I am learning Adobe CS 6, and front-end web design. I freelance for <a href="http://digitalgravitymedia.com" target="_blank">Digital Gravity Media</a>, a SEO company based in Stamford, CT.</p>
    <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
     <p>My dream job would be with a company where I could design, develop, maintain and update websites. I would want to be constantly challenged and given the opportuinity to learn new scripting languages and programs.</p>
   <h2>If you could do anything, what would you do?</h2>
      <p> I would travel the world and experience different cultures. I would love to try my hand at creating different types of cuisines. Looking at the art and architecture around the world would be fascinating.</p>
