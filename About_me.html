  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p class="aboutText">I love gummy bears. I would eat gummy bears for breakfast, lunch and dinner if no one would judge me. But you're probably looking for something a bit more descriptive than that.</p>
    <p class="aboutText">I have a passion for learning and am constantly trying new things. Whether it is a new recipe, a new crochet or knitting pattern (I learned to knit this year through youtube and online tutorials!), a new computer program or figuring out why a line of code does what it does, I enjoy thinking things out.</p>
    <p class="aboutText">I'm both logical and creative, but my logical side wins out more often than my creativity, especially when I am learning. This isn't always a bad thing. </p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What sort of professional background do you have?</h2>
      <p class="aboutText">I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelors of Science in Art Education. During my time at college, I focused on studio arts including graphic design. After graduating, I taught for a few years and even though I enjoyed the being with children I realized teaching was not for me. I started getting back into graphic design and began relearning the Adobe Creative Suite. </p>
      <p class="aboutText">Most recently, I've been learning online through <a href="http://www.thinkful.com" target="blank">thinkful.com</a>. I will be completing their frontend web development course within the next month. From there I plan to continue by taking Frontend AngularJS.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">In 2010 I was hired by Penny-Dell Publications and learned Quark Xpress 6. I am a desktop publisher who designs both print and digital publications. I freelance on occasion for <a href="http://digitalgravitymedia.com" target="_blank">Digital Gravity Media</a>, a SEO company based in Stamford, CT.</p>
    <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
     <p class="aboutText">My dream job would be with a company where I could design, develop, maintain and update websites. I would want to be constantly challenged and given the opportunity to learn new scripting languages and programs.</p>
    <h2>What is your design style?</h2>
      <p class="aboutText">I think all design should be:
        <ul class="designList">
          <li class="emphasisPoint">User friendly</li>
            <p class="aboutText indent">Let&#39s be honest, no one likes to be confused. User-friendly design is a must. If no one can understand it, no one will use it, read it, think about it</p>
          <li class="emphasisPoint">Simple</li>
            <p class="aboutText indent">Simple and streamlined designs are a must.<br>
            But design should also make you think. There is a reason we have brains, after all.</p>
          <li class="emphasisPoint">Satisfy our basic need to communicate</li>
            <p class="aboutText indent">Imagine a world without paintings, sculptures, books, music; a world where no one communicates. A grey world without creativity, thought, wonder. Pretty boring, right?<br>
            From cave paintings to digital media, we all just want to share our thoughts. </p>
        </ul>
